<h1>🌍 About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! My name is Volkan, and I’m currently a Computer Science student who is on a
  lifelong mission to turn coffee into code. Most of my days are split between solving bugs,
  creating even stranger ones, and then pretending that I knew what I was doing all along.</p>

<p>💻 When it comes to coding, I’m the type of person who celebrates small victories like
  fixing a semicolon error as if I’ve just launched a rocket to Mars. Debugging is basically
  my second language, and Stack Overflow feels like my extended family.</p>

<p>⚡ Outside of tech, I’m all about staying curious and keeping things fun. I enjoy
   challenging myself, learning new skills, and laughing at my own mistakes 
   (because let’s be honest—there are a lot of them). Whether it’s exploring new ideas,
    brainstorming crazy solutions, or just enjoying the little things in life, I like to
    keep the energy high and the vibes positive.</p>

<p>☕ Fun fact: I firmly believe that behind every successful program is an unhealthy 
  amount of caffeine.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I’m just a curious mind who loves building, breaking,
   and rebuilding things — both in tech and in life.</p>
